        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded in 1913 at New York University.
             The Rho Chapter at the University of Rhode Island was
             established in 1928. Over the past 4 years, our chapter has
             had a resurgence in membership and involvement. We are proud
             of our history and excited for our future.</p>
